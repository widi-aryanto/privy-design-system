## Pattern Rule

### Best Practice
<div class="flex">
  <div class="w-2/3">
    <ul>
      <li>Let people know what happens when the toggle is switched by using a tooltip.</li>
      <li>Toggles should never require users to press a button to apply the settings.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Do
<div class="flex">
  <div class="w-2/3">
    <ul>
      <li>Use toggles when your intent is to turn something on or off instantly.</li>
      <li>Use for any feature or option that can be turned on or off.</li>
      <li>If a physical switch would work for the action, the toggle is probably the best component to use.</li>
      <li>Use for making it possible to choose one or more options from a limited number of options.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

### Don’t
<div class="flex">
  <div class="w-2/3">
    <ul>
      <li>Toggles should never require users to click a button to apply or save the setting.</li>
      <li>Avoid using when you have more than 10 options to choose from.</li>
      <li>
        Don’t change the selection of another toggle when another one is clicked. Only exception is when a toggle is used to make a bulk selection of multiple items.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
